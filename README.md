# Budland 2.0 rewrite repo

**The name of this project will soon change, but its this for now.**

## Install

To install this just clone the repo and install it using zig build, the dependencies will be fetched with the repo.
**NOTE: This currently requires zig 0.15+**

## About

Budland is a wayland compositor that uses a container system simmilar to tiling. I made this because I got sick of manually moving all my windows.

## Config

More documentation to come later, for now see [the sample config.](sample.conf)

## Screenshots

Another work in progress section, I want to get this project stable before I share my sexy setup!
